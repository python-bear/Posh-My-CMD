# Posh-My-CMD #


## Description ##
Make your CMD prompt look better with colors, powerline characters, environment variables, and more.  

## Versions ##
There are two versions of this application, the Basic-CMD-Poshifier.py version and the Posh-My-CMD.py version. Both can be found in the `Program` folder of this repository. The Basic-CMD-Poshifier is the original version, it has a harder to visualize syntax for making prompts but most of the time is faster to use when making new prompts. The Posh-My-CMD version has an easier to understand syntax for prompt making but will probably take more time to make a new prompt. Enter `-help` in either of the running programs' Python terminals to display their help message.
